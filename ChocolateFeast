Complete the chocolateFeast function in the editor below. It must return the number of chocolates Bobby can eat after taking full advantage of the promotion.

chocolateFeast has the following parameter(s):

n: an integer representing Bobby's initial amount of money
c: an integer representing the cost of a chocolate bar
m: an integer representing the number of wrappers he can turn in for a free bar
Note: Little Bobby will always turn in his wrappers if he has enough to get a free chocolate.


static int chocolateFeast(int n, int c, int m) {

        int bars = n/c;
        int wrapper = 0;
        int eaten = 0;

        while(bars != 0){

            bars--;
            wrapper++;
            eaten++;
            if (wrapper >= m){
                wrapper -= m;
                bars++;
            }
        }

        return eaten;
    }
